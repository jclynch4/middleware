<h4>With the arrival of the Spaniards to the native populations of the Caribbean, the blacks of the African colonies located in this region of the world were introduced. There is a great ethnic mix of the Cuban population, basically composed of Caucasians, African blacks and mulattoes; the latter is the result of the mixture of the first two population groups and, 
to a lesser extent, of other populations such as China and Indo-American.</h4>
