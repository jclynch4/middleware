<h3>Cubans are sociable and friendly people. They can converse with anyone and seem to spend most of the time interacting 
with others. As you walk through the streets, you will see people sitting outside their homes talking to their neighbors. 
It is common to see couples kissing, children kicking soccer balls and men playing chess. People are intimately interconnected, which is especially refreshing for foreigners who come from countries where technology has replaced interpersonal communication. 
In fact, the lack of technology in Cuba (cell phones, televisions, and computers) has made socialization a necessity. </h3>
