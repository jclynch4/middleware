<h3>Here in our facility you can participate in activitiesthe where you will interact with natural people from the archipelago. Cubans are sociable and friendly people. They can converse with anyone and seem to spend most of their time interacting with others. As you walk the streets, you will see people sitting outside their houses talking to their neighbors. It is common to see couples kissing, children kicking soccer balls, and men playing chess. People are intimately interconnected, which is especially reassuring for foreigners who come from countries where technology has replaced interpersonal communication. In fact, the lack of technology in Cuba (cell phones, televisions, and computers) has made socialization a necessity.
